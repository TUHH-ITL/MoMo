MoMo is an innovative, open-source modular mobile robot designed for diverse research applications within indoor environments. Developed at the Institute of Technical Logistics at TUHH, Hamburg, Germany, MoMo empowers researchers to explore and innovate in fields such as localization, perception, manipulation and more.

## Key Features

- **Modularity**: Easily swap out top modules to shift between research applications like localization, perception, and manipulation.
- **Compatibility**: Fully compatible with ROS2 and ROS1, facilitating easy integration into existing projects.
- **Customizability**: Users can attach any sensor of their choice as a top module, allowing for a personalized research tool.

## Modular Concept

MoMo is designed with simplicity and accessibility in mind. It's easy to assemble using standard parts, and its open-source design allows for extensive customization and improvements. Different modules can be developed, such as a perception module equipped with lidar and cameras or a manipulation module featuring a robotic arm.
